# Orleans.EventStore

This is pretty much a lab around Orleans StreamProvider API, as EventStore does not fit well in Orleans StreamProvider model, which is a queue management API.

[One other attempt (.NET Framework and Orleans 1.5)](https://github.com/jamescarter-le/OrleansEventStoreProvider).

Some StreamProvider implementations, as [the documentation](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/streaming/stream_providers.html) is really scarce on the subject:
